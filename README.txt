# ethSmartContract

**ethSmartContract** is a simple Solidity smart contract that allows a designated minter to create new coins (tokens) and transfer them between accounts. The contract is designed to be easily understandable for beginners and serves as a basic example of minting and transferring tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Introduction

This contract provides a basic framework for minting and transferring tokens on the Ethereum network. The contract owner (minter) is the only one authorized to mint new tokens, and users can send tokens to each other once they have been minted.

## Features

- **Minting**: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
- **Token Transfers**: Users can transfer their tokens to other users.
- **Event Emission**: The contract emits an event whenever a token transfer occurs.

## Getting Started

To interact with this contract, you'll need to have basic knowledge of Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contracts. You will also need to install development tools like `Truffle` or `Hardhat` for deployment and testing.

## Contract Details

- **Solidity Version**: `0.5.1`
- **License**: MIT

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v10 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or later)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) compiler
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for development and testing

## Functions

### `constructor()`

- Initializes the contract by setting the `minter` address to the account that deploys the contract.

### `mint(address receiver, uint amount)`

- Mints new tokens and assigns them to the specified `receiver`.
- **Requirements**: Only the minter can call this function. The amount should be less than `1e60`.

### `send(address receiver, uint amount)`

- Sends tokens from the sender's balance to the specified `receiver`.
- **Requirements**: The sender must have a balance greater than or equal to the `amount` to be transferred.

### `balances(address _account) external view returns (uint)`

- Returns the balance of the specified `_account`.

### Events

- `Sent(address from, address to, uint amount)`: Triggered whenever tokens are transferred between addresses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethSmartContract.git

    ```
2. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    truffle test
    ```
